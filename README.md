pellet-dispenser
================

This is a project I'm helping my son with. His school has a yearly event called Ace Innovation where students come up with some sort of invention. His idea is an automatic plastic pellet dispensing machine to help his mom with her weighted blanket business. This machine will speed up the weighing of plastic pellets that are used in the weighted blankets.
